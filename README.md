# all-cell-detection
We experimented ML models for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell detection

## Running environment
All Jupyter notebooks were originally executed in the Google Colab environment.

## Data sources
ALL cell data used is from [ALL-IDB](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/)

## CNN classification

We use a custom CNN model for ALL classification.

## YOLO models

Three different YOLO models (v5, v6, and v7) were tried to compare performance.
